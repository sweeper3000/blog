  <h2>Hello World</h2>
  <p>This blog will feature my thoughts on privacy, cryptography, and mass surveillance. I am no cryptography expert, but I get the basic idea. This blog will be hosted on GitHub pages. This is good for a number of reasons:
  <ol>
   <li>Free.</li>
   <li>Easy - just make a repo and use the branch 'gh-pages'. Then push the html.</li>
   <li>Transparent - GitHub allows you to see the changes made over time via the git commits.</li>
   <li>Free SSL - Although you can get a free SSL certificate that is trusted by browsers, this feature is turned on be default as of recently which, in turn requires not setup.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>This blog is something I plan to keep updated, but there won't be a specific timeframe to follow.</p>
