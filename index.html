   <h2>Encryption Under Threat in Europe</h2>
   <small>Wednesday August 24, 2016</small>
   <p>Intelligence officials in France and Germany are calling to access to encrypted communications. This is another case in the crypto wars that have been playing out over the past rough decade, flaring up in intensity fairly recently.</p>

   <p>The two nations have been hit by terror attacks recently, France taking a much bigger blunder. From the November Paris attacks to the machete attack in Germany, the intelligence communities in those countries want a Europe-wide law that forces encrypted apps to decrypt data if requested. This type of law is nothing new. In response to the Apple vs FBI battle, over the San Bernadino shooter's phone, there was the Compliance With Court Orders Act, which would amount to the same demands that are once again occuring. That Act didn't make it very far. It's surprising in Germany, where privacy has been held dear, due to the nation's history where the East was under Soviet rule and the knowledge the KGB could be listening in on your phone was drilled into the mind. The fact that the government has been encouraging ciizens to use end to end encryption. The same cannot be said for France, which wanted to <a href="https://motherboard.vice.com/read/after-paris-attacks-proposed-french-law-would-block-tor-and-forbid-free-wi-fi">block Tor</a> after the Paris attacks.</p>
   <p>Whenever a terrorist attacks, governments always blame encryption. Even if there was no evidence encryption was used, they use these tragidies to pust their anti-encryption agenda. Strong encryption is one of the few, if not only defense against mass surveillance, and a backdoor into encryption will only bring us back to square one. Terrorists hate our freedom, they want to take over nation after nation and impose an oppresive rule. They want world dommination, sans-freedom. So why is the solution to stop terror attacks have to be the erosion of our freedoms? Encryption can actually <em>protect</em> against terrorists, if they target you in a cyber attack. But they can unfortunatly help terrorists hide. This will happen. They will use encryption. But they have used cars, should we ban cars too? Encryption doesn't change because of the person using it. According to Edward Snowden, during a debate with Fareed Zakaria on encryption, he says this of encryption: "Encryption is a field of mathematics. It the same for Mother Teresa as it does for Osama Bin Laden."</p>
   <p>Edward is right. I am also saddened by Germany's potential shift from pro to anti-encryption. There are very few countries, if not the only country that is outspokenly pro-encryption.</p>

   <h2>Why You Shouldn't use BBM</h2>
   <small>Tuesday August 16, 2016</small>
   <p>Got a Blackberry Priv? Got your eye on a DTEK50? It certainly has Blackberry Messenger (BBM) on it, a messaging app the Blackberry promotes as secure. But there are numerous issues with BBM which I will talk about.</p>
   <a id="expand-no-bbm" href="#">Read More</a>
  </div>
  <div class="post-content" id="bbm-01">
   <p>BBM, an IM app developed by Blackberry is said to be a secure messaging app aimed primarily at businesses. The app uses a global encryption key on <em>all</em> clients, the exception being those using BES servers, where you can have your own encryption key. This means Blackberry has that key and delivers it to each client in a certain fashion. It could not have generated the same key on the device, you will get a different key, that's just the nature of key generation. Another huge concern, or dare I say, red flag is that the RCMP has had <a href="https://motherboard.vice.com/read/rcmp-blackberry-project-clemenza-global-encryption-key-canada">access</a> to Blackberry's global key since 2010 and as far as I am concerned, continues to have access, and was able to intercept all messages encrypted by that global key. This is very hypocrtical of Blackberry, which ended operations in countries that have requested backdoor access. Giving the key to the RCMP is the same thing. A backdoor is a backdoor no matter the implementation.</p>
   <p>You can have end-to-end encrypted conversations, only if you pay for BBM Protected, which gives you a PGP-like system. Both users have to be subscribed to this service. There is no forward secrecy, where your past messages are protected if your keys are compromised, something which the Signal Protocol has. Forward secrecy is arguably needed in cryptography these days.</p>
   <p>Instead, I strongly encourage you to ditch BBM in favor of Signal, or if open source doesn't matter to you, an app that uses the Signal Protocol such as WhatsApp. I cannot recommed the soon to be released Google Allo (at time of writing) or Facebook Messenger, because end to end encryption is not turned on by default. Another plus of Signal and WhatsApp is that calls are end to end encrypted too. But seriously, use Signal as your top choice. It's fast, it's easy and frictionless. And yes, I see Signal being mentioned on many of my posts.</p>

   <h2>Use Signal</h2>
   <small>Wednesday August 10, 2016</small>
   <p><b>I have more comprehensive documentation <a href="https://worldofwebsites.github.io/PrivacyMatters/tools/signal/index.html">here</a></b></p>
   <p>Signal Private Messenger - by Open Whisper Systems is a simple way to communicate with friends and family securely.</p>
   <a id="expand-signal" href="#">Read More</a>
  </div>
  <div class="post-content" id="signal-01">
   <p>Signal's goal is to make private communication simple. The app uses the state-of-the-art Signal Protocol, which is designed for security, and speed, so it can operate in one of the most constrained environments in tech - the smartphone. The smartphone has many factors that can influence the app, mainly:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>Battery</li>
    <li>Constant network changes</li>
   </ul> 
   <p>The Signal Protocol is designed to work in this environment.</p>
   <p>The Signal Protocol is so good, its the gold standard of encryption for the experts, because of its forward secrecy, which ensures that if the long-term keys are stolen, the attacker cannot decrypt old conversations -- because the key used to encrypt the message has been discarded. The Signal Protocol is beginning to be widely adopted for other messengers like <a href="https://whispersystems.org/blog/whatsapp-complete/">WhatsApp</a>, <a href="https://whispersystems.org/blog/allo/">Google Allo</a> and <a href="https://whispersystems.org/blog/facebook-messenger/">Facebook Messenger</a>.</p>
   <p>Signal can be used by anyone, and is used by anyone. From activists at the Republican National Convention in 2016, journalists like those at <em>The Intercept</em>, Edward Snowden, right down to the average person.</p>
   <p>When Open Whisper Systems says they can't see your messages, they can't. Everything is end-to-end encypted, where you can verify key fingerprints and where the private keys never leave the device. There is even end-to-end encrypted phone calls, and you can verify those too.</p>
   <p><a href="https://whispersystems.org">Open Whisper Systems</a> does amazing work, crafting a very nice looking secure messenger. If you want to help them out, you can <a href="https://freedom.press/bundle/encryption-tools-journalists">donate</a> via the Freedom of Press Foundation, or <a href="https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md">contribute</a> by giving code, let them know about bugs, or just spread the word.</p>
   <p>Signal can be downloaded on Android, IOS, and as a Chrome app linked to an Android phone. Just register your phone number with the server and you can start chatting with your friends and family fast.

  <h2>Hello World</h2>
  <small>Wednesday August 8, 2016</small>
  <p>This blog will feature my thoughts on privacy, cryptography, and mass surveillance. I am no cryptography expert, but I get the basic idea. This blog will be hosted on GitHub pages. This is good for a number of reasons:
  <ol>
   <li>Free.</li>
   <li>Easy - just make a repo and use the branch 'gh-pages'. Then push the html.</li>
   <li>Transparent - GitHub allows you to see the changes made over time via the git commits.</li>
   <li>Free SSL - Although you can get a free SSL certificate that is trusted by browsers, this feature is turned on be default as of recently which, in turn requires not setup.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>This blog is something I plan to keep updated, but there won't be a specific timeframe to follow.</p>
