   <h2>Use Signal</h2>
   <small>Wednesday August 10, 2016</small>
   <p><b>I have more comprehensive documentation <a href="https://worldofwebsites.github.io/PrivacyMatters/tools/signal/index.html">here</a></b></p>
   <p>Signal Private Messenger - by Open Whisper Systems is a simple way to communicate with friends and family securely.</p>

   <p>Signal's goal is to make private communication simple. The app uses the state-of-the-art Signal Protocol, which is designed for security, and speed, so it can operate in one of the most constrained environments in tech - the smartphone. The smartphone has many factors that can influence the app, mainly:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>Battery</li>
    <li>Constant network changes</li>
   </ul> 
   <p>The Signal Protocol is designed to work in this environment.</p>
   <p>The Signal Protocol is so good, its the gold standard of encryption for the experts, because of its forward secrecy, which ensures that if the long-term keys are stolen, the attacker cannot decrypt old conversations -- because the key used to encrypt the message has been discarded. The Signal Protocol is beginning to be widely adopted for other messengers like <a href="https://whispersystems.org/blog/whatsapp-complete/">WhatsApp</a>, <a href="https://whispersystems.org/blog/allo/">Google Allo</a> and <a href="https://whispersystems.org/blog/facebook-messenger/">Facebook Messenger</a>.</p>
   <p>Signal can be used by anyone, and is used by anyone. From activists at the Republican National Convention in 2016, journalists like those at <em>The Intercept</em>, Edward Snowden, right down to the average person.</p>
   <p>When Open Whisper Systems says they can't see your messages, they can't. Everything is end-to-end encypted, where you can verify key fingerprints and where the private keys never leave the device. There is even end-to-end encrypted phone calls, and you can verify those too.</p>
   <p><a href="https://whispersystems.org">Open Whisper Systems</a> does amazing work, crafting a very nice looking secure messenger. If you want to help them out, you can <a href="https://freedom.press/bundle/encryption-tools-journalists">donate</a> via the Freedom of Press Foundation, or <a href="https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md">contribute</a> by giving code, let them know about bugs, or just spread the word.</p>
   <p>Signal can be downloaded on Android, IOS, and as a Chrome app linked to an Android phone. Just register your phone number with the server and you can start chatting with your friends and family fast.

  <h2>Hello World</h2>
  <small>Wednesday August 8, 2016</small>
  <p>This blog will feature my thoughts on privacy, cryptography, and mass surveillance. I am no cryptography expert, but I get the basic idea. This blog will be hosted on GitHub pages. This is good for a number of reasons:
  <ol>
   <li>Free.</li>
   <li>Easy - just make a repo and use the branch 'gh-pages'. Then push the html.</li>
   <li>Transparent - GitHub allows you to see the changes made over time via the git commits.</li>
   <li>Free SSL - Although you can get a free SSL certificate that is trusted by browsers, this feature is turned on be default as of recently which, in turn requires not setup.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>This blog is something I plan to keep updated, but there won't be a specific timeframe to follow.</p>
